### Objectives
I intend to change the atmosphere from "what's the bar I need to make it over to get a job" to "how can I be the best I can possibly be". I want SFSU students to pursue extra-curricular projects in order to broaden not just what we know, but get a better idea of the things we don't. 
Technical seminars and workshops are prevalent around the Bay Area and I want to make these more visible and more accessible to students. I know we receive benefits for being a recognized ACM chapter so I want to push for at least the cost of admission to some of these events to be covered by our parent organization. Additionally I would encourage students to apply for things like ACM Student Chapter Scholarship or the Student Chapter Excellence Program. 
Highlighting the ACM job portal also help students get a better scale for projects they could be working on that rise above standard academic work. With all these factors together, my goal is for more clubs and organizations to be created in new fields of interest and for them to reside under the ACM umbrella. I hope that as we get closer to selecting a new chair and in the coming year, I can get a clearer picture from past leadership about the benefits we provide to our smaller organizations in tandem with the official chapter members.

### Qualifications
I have years of development experience in larger teams, and was most recently a software developer working on production code for a globally distributed security software. I have experience with project management, application of core programming principles, and I'm an example of how productive it can be to throw yourself into a project, without enough knowledge, in order to learn and grow. I was the vice president of my community college's Archery club and a member of the Society of American Military Engineers which sought to connect architects, engineers and builders in the public sector and private industry in a very similar way to ACM.

### Objectives
As you all know, I am one of the Co-Founders of our Lean In Student chapter here on campus. Lean In is a student-based organization that advocates for more female representation in technology. In terms of leadership within a group, I have helped host multiple events, mainly that of company tech talks. I have had the privilege of helping host companies such as Twilio, Reddit, Cisco, Nutanix, and IBM. As per personal experiences I was fortunate enough to be able to attend the Grace Hopper Conference (a diversity career fair that celebrates women in tech) as a scholar, which opened my eyes to the world of networking. I was able to see the power of personally connecting with industry professionals with various companies including Uber, IBM, Google, etc. I believe I have enough experience with leading a group of passionate Computer Science students, like yourselves.

### Qualifications
As ACM President, I would like to push more towards networking (including more resume building workshops, soft skill workshops, and interviewing techniques) as well as technical interview practice sessions. I would also wish to implement some sort of Mental Relief Day once a week (we can all decide when we want to do it but activities would include playing board games or even coloring books and stuff, or even just writing anonymous complements on sticky notes and posting them around the lab). 

I wish to stress on these activities because throughout my experience, I learned that networking is a very important skill and it helped me realize that our students within the department will need this skill to help them with internship and job hunting (which, as I recognized, was a major concern within our students here at State). I plan to continue to assist students through their career search, be it internships or full-time employment opportunities, by recommending networking events around the city. Computer Science is already stressful as it is and we already have an amazing and supportive sense of community inside of our Slack channel and personally feel that I have grown so much with you guys by my side. We need to push each other to help each other grow and I want to be there to experience our growth and successes together.
